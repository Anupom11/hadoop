Fork from apache/hadoop

We did two modifications to this repository of hadoop.
1. Addition of a new class file named- FileOpTracer
2. Modified the FSEditLog class to call the methods of FileOpTracer

----Concept----
Here we add a new journal file concept to record the file move operations inside the file system. 
Though that kind of records are recorded in the EditLog file as a transaction format, but that 
details are used to sync the FSImage. 

Further if we want to extract information from the EditLog then we have to go through the number of 
EditLog files for that particular piece of information and also this will be an I/O and CPU intense 
process.

So we store that information in a particular file, and the application developer can access that files 
without directly.
